\chapter*{Abstract}
Honeypots are cybersecurity expedients that aim at luring attackers, exposing less or more realistic services. Attackers should not realize to be dealing with such decoy systems.\\ 
The taxonomy of honeypots is wide, many categories exist: Malware, DoS, Web Application are among them. Although being similar, they all serve for a different purpose.\\ 
This report gives an overview of the different honeypot flavors and the attacks they aim at constrasting. \\ 
The work also focuses on two use cases of two systems deploying honeypots against two different threats: a ransomware attack and a DoS attack.\\ 
Moreover, a close look to the implementation of both solutions is provided.\\ 
Finally, their results and final considerations are taken into account.

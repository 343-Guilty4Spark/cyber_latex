\chapter{Introduction}
A Honeypot is a  sacrificial system intended to attract cyberattackers, it mimics a target and gain information about cybercriminals and how they operate.
This project aims at providing an overview of the state-of-the-art regarding honeypots and describes two implementations of Honeypot inside a cluster IoT.\\
The document gives an overview of the various type of Honeypot to better understand the final goal of the project: develop a honeypot mechanism capable of attract the attacker and give a feedback of what the attacker was trying to do.\\
Two solutions has been presented for different type of cluster and attack: one solution for a honeypot in a fully connected mesh cluster that protects from Malware attacks and a second one for a tree structured cluster that protects from DoS attacks. \\
The remainder of the document is organized as follows. In Chapter 2 it has been analyzed the various honeypot classification; in Chapter 3 it has been proposed a closer look to various honeypot typologies according to the attack; in Chapter 4 it  has been introduced an overview of the two solutions; in Chapter 5 it has been analyzed the implementation of the two solution and in Chapter 6 It is possible to see the results.

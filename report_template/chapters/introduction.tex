\chapter{Introduction}
A Honeypot is a sacrificial system intended to attract cyber attackers, it mimics a target and gains
information about cybercriminals and how they operate. This project aims at providing an overview
of the state-of-the-art regards honeypots and describes two implementations of Honeypot inside a
cluster IoT.\\
The document gives an overview of the various type of Honeypot to better understand the final goal
of the project: develop a honeypot mechanism capable of attracting the attacker and giving feedback of
what the attacker was trying to do.
Two solutions have been presented for different types of clusters and attacks: one solution for a honeypot
in a fully connected mesh cluster that protects from Malware attacks and a second one for a tree structure cluster that protects from DoS attacks.\\
The remainder of the document is organized as follows. In Chapter 2 it has been analyzed the various
honeypot classification; in Chapter 3 it has been proposed a closer look at various honeypot typologies
according to the attack; Chapter 4  it has been introduced an overview of the two solutions; in
Chapter 5  it has been analyzed the implementation of the two solutions and in Chapter 6 It is possible to see the results.
